Pyodide 0.21 is a major release focused on improvements to the systems for
building and loading packages. We added support for out of tree package builds
which should soon make it much easier for people to build binary packages that
we do not include in our distribution. We added support for Rust packages and
made major progress in supporting CMake packages. We also added 34 new packages
including a large number of popular packages, for example bitarray,
opencv-python, shapely, and xgboost.

We moved from Emscripten v2.0.27 to Emscripten v3.1.14 which includes almost all
of the patches we need (we still apply two patches). There were also many minor
improvements and bugfixes to the Pyodide module and type conversions.



For the complete list of changes see the
[changelog](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/project/changelog.html#version-0-21-0).

## Out of tree binary package builds for Pyodide

The most exciting new feature in Pyodide 0.21.0 is that it adds experimental
support for building binary packages for Pyodide "out of tree".

Pyodide has so far used a monolothic collection of package recipes inspired by
Conda to build binary extensions. Using a collection of package recipes has
significant advantages, allowing us to maintain patches and test all of the
packages together. However, it also has several downsides:

1. It requires all packages to be maintained in a monorepo.

2. It doesn't allow packages to support Pyodide in their CI.

3. There is no convenient way for someone to use a personal-use binary extension
   with Pyodide.

4. There is no good way to have several different versions of the same package.
   For instance, this would be very helpful for using Pyodide to make
   interactive documentation for old versions of a package.

We can build most packages out of tree, though this feature is still a bit
experimental. We will continue using the collection of package recipes for our
in-tree builds. Our goal is to add Pyodide to the CI of key packages, for
instance as a proof of concept we have added Pyodide to the Numpy CI in a draft
PR. In order to limit CI time, we only run a small fragment of each package's
tests in Pyodide's CI. However, the package's CI can run all of its tests in
Pyodide. This should help tremendously with locating and fixing subtle
Pyodide-only bugs.

## Improvements to package loading

In order to support loading of packages built out of tree, we updated micropip
to be able to load binary wheels and to be able to generate custom lock files.
We also added the capability of specifying custom lock files in `loadPyodide`.
Custom lock files feature may help significantly with loading time for certain
applications and can also be useful for people who want to add extra packages to
their repls to be loaded with `loadPackagesFromImports`.

## Rust and CMake support

Pyodide can now build Rust packages! Not only that, but PyO3 packages just work
with almost no extra configuration. [This blog
post](https://blog.pyodide.org/posts/rust-pyo3-support-in-pyodide/) has a
breakdown of the technical issues that needed to be fixed for this. PyO3 and
maturin have added Pyodide to their test suites and setuptools-rust will soon
too. Many thanks to the PyO3 developers Messense and David Hewitt, to the Rust
developers who reviewed the PRs, to Sam Clegg, and many others for helping with
this!

We also made progress with CMake support. The current status is that we know how
to build most CMake packages but it requires quite specialized knowledge.
Hopefully future work can make this a bit simpler.
