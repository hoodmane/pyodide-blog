Pyodide 0.21 is a major release focused on improvements to the systems for
building and loading packages. We added support for out of tree package builds
and Rust packages, 

There were also many minor improvements and bugfixes to the Pyodide module and
type conversions.

For the complete list of changes see the
[changelog](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/project/changelog.html#version-0-21-0).

## Out of tree binary package builds for Pyodide

The most exciting new feature in Pyodide 0.21.0 is that it adds experimental
support for building binary packages for Pyodide "out of tree". Pyodide has so
far used a monolothic collection of package recipes inspired by Conda to build
binary extensions. This works quite well but it has several downsides:

1. It requires all packages to be maintained in a monorepo. 

2. It doesn't allow packages to support Pyodide in their CI.

3. There is no convenient way for someone to use a personal-use binary extension
   with Pyodide.

4. There is no good way to have several different versions of the same package.
   For instance, this would be very helpful for using Pyodide to make
   interactive documentation for old versions of a package.

It also has some significant advantages, like the fact that all of the packages
are tested together.

## Improvements to package loading

In order to support loading of packages built out of tree, we updated micropip
to be able to load binary wheels and to be able to generate custom lock files.

## Rust support

Pyodide can now build Rust packages!
